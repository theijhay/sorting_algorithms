0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O

A Sorting Algorithm is used to rearrange a given array or list of elements according to a comparison operator on the elements. The comparison operator is used to decide the new order of elements in the respective data structure.

Sorting Algorithms:

Selection Sort
Bubble Sort
Insertion Sort
Merge Sort
Quick Sort
Heap Sort
Counting Sort
Radix Sort
Bucket Sort
Bingo Sort Algorithm
ShellSort
TimSort
Comb Sort
Pigeonhole Sort
Cycle Sort
Cocktail Sort
Strand Sort
Bitonic Sort
Pancake sorting
BogoSort or Permutation Sort
Gnome Sort
Sleep Sort – The King of Laziness
Structure Sorting in C++
Stooge Sort
Tag Sort (To get both sorted and original)
Tree Sort
Odd-Even Sort / Brick Sort
3-way Merge Sort
